# Welcome!
Hello there and welcome to Dinnerly! Have you ever been stuck in a debate with family or friends over where you should go out to eat. Maybe you had it down to 3 or so choices and could not decide fairly where to go? This app solves this issue by choosing for you! 

# How it works
There are two ways to decide:
* You can select pre-made categories provided
* Create custom categories

Pre-made Categories:
* Selecting the option to proceed to the pre-made categories will give options for the most common types of restaurants. You can select as many to decide between, but at least two must be selected. 
* Users can click the arrow beside the category to get a description of things you may find there: such as price range, type of food, atmosphere
* Next, click the "Randomize" button and a wheel will be spun. The category it lands on will pop up as the chosen category and restaurants that fit it near you will be displayed

Custom Categories:
* Enter the amount of categories you'd like to chose between and fill in all boxes.
* Bullet point #3 for Pre-made categories will be repeated

# Feedback
Please leave a review on the Google Play store and we'll get back as soon as we can!
